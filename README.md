# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web Â· 20-21

In this course we will convert the client side web application previously made [Web App From Scratch](https://github.com/RickGroot/web-app-from-scratch-2021) into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately we are going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.

## This project
Pintreddit is a simple web application for inspiration. This project uses the reddit API, and data from reddit and puts it into your browser. With random images every refresh inspiration is guaranteed!

## Progress
### Week 1

**JS files of this project are currently located in ./src/scripts!**

First week of this course I was setting up my project with different types of compilers and bundlers. I looked into npm scripts and setting up simple commands. After this week I could use my main function, but modules were not supported because of the use of node, which doesn't support modules. I got my main version working using rollup and node, but that's not enough to get all functionality to my app, so I started testing different compilers and bundlers like browserify and babel. At the end of this week I got my main functionality working using nodemon, babel, express and ejs.  

To-Do:
* **create live version** *!important*
* Build script
* Adding a detail page
* Data manipulation, checking image types (optional)

### Week 2
New week, new me. This week I started making some progress. I realised babel and other stuff isn't necessary for now, so I deleted that functionality. After that I started pushing to heroku, which worked and now I can see all of my stuff in the browser. It's a huge cleanup which has set me back, but I think from here on out I can make good progress. Next I started adding more modules, and more pages. Now there is a detail page whitch fetches a single image, and also a not found page.  
I also implemented a manifest.json which contains all icons and colors, and I addd a serviceworker. My serviceworker saves some data from the app, like my manifest file, an offline page and the CSS. If the user has nog internet connection the pages will not be fetched, and instead it renders an offline page. This only works when the user has visited the site before.

## Install this project

## Features
* Get inspired
* Choose your image category
* Look at image details
* See different images every time

## Data
Data below is some data of an image. This is just a small section of all image data that gets passed to the application trough the reddit API.    

This is some data manipulation to get to the correct data:
```js
let post = data[0].data.children[0].data;
```
    
And this is a section of the JSON data from 'post':
```json
{
    "hide_score": false,
    "id": "ljfawo",
    "link_flair_css_class": null,
    "link_flair_richtext": [],

### API Drawbacks
The reddit API is huge, and sends you lost of information about everything that has relation to the origional post. This means that every comment, and all userdata is sent via the API. Because of this it's difficult to get the correct data into the application. Another drawback is loading speed. The objects are big, and take some time to load, especially with multiple posts. Same goes for image sizes, feched images from these posts are big file sizes and take some time to load.
